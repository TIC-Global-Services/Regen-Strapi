        question: "How long do home solar batteries last?",
        answer: "Most modern home batteries are designed to last between 10 and 15 years. They typically come with a 10-year manufacturer warranty guaranteeing about 70-80% of their initial capacity after a decade of daily usage.",
      },
      {
        question: "What is Depth of Discharge (DoD)?",
        answer: "Depth of Discharge refers to the percentage of the battery's capacity that can be safely used without damaging the cells. High-quality LFP batteries like Tesla and iStore support 100% DoD, meaning you can use their full capacity.",
      },
      {
        question: "Which battery brand is best for going off-grid?",
        answer: "For off-grid applications, modular batteries with high-peak output capabilities like BYD Premium, or heavy-duty systems like Sigenergy SigenStor, are highly recommended because they allow you to customize capacity and handle large surge currents.",
      },
      {
        question: "Are there government rebates available for battery installation in Perth?",
        answer: "Yes. Western Australian residents can stack federal incentives (Cheaper Home Batteries Program) with state-level rebates (WA Residential Battery Scheme) for a combined saving of up to $7,500 on a 10 kWh battery.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do I choose the right battery capacity for my home?",
        answer: "The right size depends on your household energy consumption overnight and your solar generation. A standard 4-person household in Perth usually finds a capacity of 10 kWh to 13.5 kWh provides the best balance of cost and utility.",
